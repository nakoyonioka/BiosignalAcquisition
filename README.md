# BiosignalAcquisition
 This repository contains the design files for a multi-channel system capable of acquiring, conditioning, and digitizing biosignals. The system includes analog front-ends for four input channels, with one channel featuring a Driven Right Leg (DRL) circuit for common-mode noise rejection, integrated power management, and a digital interface for data output.
